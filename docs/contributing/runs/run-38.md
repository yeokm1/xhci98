# Phase 38 Record

The detail behind `docs/contributing/roadmap-hcd.md`, "Phase 38". The
roadmap entry carries the goal, the status, the task list and the
checkpoint; this file carries what each task did and what each reading
said. Where the two disagree about a clause, the roadmap wins.

**On `out\...` and `vm\...` paths in this file.** They say where a reading
was kept on the host that took it; they are not files a clone has.

## 38.12 to 38.14 - The documents and batch files the `2.3.1.0` legs found wanting

**Verdict: done** (2026-10-13). Documents and the two batch files only; no
driver change.

**The vehicle.** Development host A, QEMU 11.1.0, four guests at once, each
on its own overlay of the read-only bases the `2.3.1.0` legs used. Kit
`out\p38-d\kit` (the `2.3.1.0` legs' kit, retargeted); readings, shots and
serial captures in `out\p38-d\legs\<guest>\` (`notes.txt` is each guest's
full list). Packages: the `2.3.1.0` asset (zip SHA-256
`F835E1DC886D6AFDB84B25E7BD89C229AE56CC0B849BBA1E232C2DFE3B707AC6`,
`release-x86`) and the published `2.3.0.0` (`releases\2.3.0.0\release-x86`);
for 38.14 the asset's `portsw\` with `portsw-on.bat` and `portsw-off.bat`
replaced by the working tree's.

### 38.14 - "RESTART WINDOWS" printed once

`portsw-on.bat` and `portsw-off.bat` no longer echo their own "RESTART
WINDOWS for the change to take effect." after a successful set;
`portsw.vbs` already prints "RESTART WINDOWS for this to take effect: the
driver reads the value only when its controller starts.", and is the one
that says it when run alone. The package self-tests now refuse a batch file
that echoes it (`test-package.ps1`, with a control that inserts the old
line); the script's own needle stays.

| Guest | Run | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 98 SE (COMMAND.COM, WSH present) | `PORTSW-ON.BAT`, `PORTSW-OFF.BAT` from `D:\PORTSW`, on screen and through `COMMAND /C ... > file` | No error; "RESTART WINDOWS" once in each; `XhciIntelPortSwitch` 1 after on, 0 after off (regedit export of `Class\USB\0002`) |
| XP SP3 (cmd.exe) | Both from a prompt, redirected to a file, by double-click from Explorer, and through `cmd /k` | No error; "RESTART WINDOWS" once in each; the value 1, then 0 (`reg query`) |

Two cosmetic notes, left as they are. A successful run now ends with two
blank lines before "Press any key": the script's last line is blank and
the batch's `echo.` adds the second, where the removed echo used to sit
between them. And on 98 SE `cscript` adds a blank line after every run, at
the prompt with no batch file too. `PORTSW-ON.BAT > C:\ON.TXT` at a
COMMAND.COM prompt does not redirect a batch file's output; `COMMAND /C`
does.

### 38.13 - 32-bit Vista: the restart after a reinstall, and on an update

The `2.3.1.0` legs saw 32-bit Vista bring the controller back at Code 1
after a remove and a rescan with no restart prompt, only an "installed
successfully" balloon (run-37, "37.final"). The readme template and the
release notes now say that a reinstall on 32-bit Vista and 7 needs the
restart whether or not Windows asks (the install steps, "Windows Vista and
7: message-signalled interrupts", and the known limitations).

The question left was whether the prompt also goes missing on an update
over an installed `xhcimsi.sys`. Read on 32-bit Vista SP2 and, as the
control, 32-bit Windows 7 SP1: `2.3.0.0` installed through Device Manager
and restarted, then `2.3.1.0` through Device Manager.

| Step | Vista SP2 x86 | 7 SP1 x86 |
|---|---|---|
| Install `2.3.0.0` (Browse my computer, the drive root) | Restart asked: the wizard's "The hardware you installed will not work until you restart your computer", then "System Settings Change", "You must restart your computer for these changes to take effect"; Code 1 until it | The same two prompts |
| Update by Browse my computer, the folder typed in | Nothing installed: "The best driver software for your device is already installed"; no prompt | The same, three times |
| Update by Let me pick from a list, Have Disk | Restart asked, the same two prompts; before it "This device is working properly. You need to restart your computer before the changes you made to this device will take effect", no problem code, `2.3.0.0` and its helper still running | The same |
| After the restart | `2.3.1.0` and helper version `2.3.1.0` running, no warning mark | The same |
| `2.3.1.0` over itself (Vista only) | Browse: nothing installed; Have Disk: the same prompts, no publisher warning | Not read |

So the prompt is missing on the remove-and-rescan path only, not on an
update. The release notes' "Updating from 2.y.y.y" and the readme
template's update section now give Have Disk for Vista and 7 and say what
the update showed before its restart.

**Why Browse keeps the old driver**, read on 7 with verbose `setupapi`
logging: the copy in the driver store ranked `0x80ff2005` and the INF on
the drive `0xf0ff2005`, both unsigned, and the lower rank wins before date
or version are compared. Vista's log at its default level shows only the
wizard ending with nothing installed. The release notes already said so
of the `1.2.0.0` upgrade; the `2.y.y.y` section did not.

### 38.12 - The UAS driver's install on Windows 7 and Vista

From the `2.3.1.0` legs (run-37, "37.final"); no new reading. The readme
template, the release notes' install steps and the acceptance test's 5.7
now say that Windows 7 shows no wizard for a UAS device (it searches
Windows Update, reports the device was not installed, and the driver goes
in through Device Manager, Update Driver Software, Browse my computer), and
that Vista's wizard names the device by its own product string, "xHCI98 USB
Attached SCSI Storage" being its name once installed.

**A harness note for later legs.** A fresh `out\p38-d\legs` lacked
`dv\DBGVIEW.EXE`, `TONE.WAV` and `stick\RAND.BIN`, which `stage.ps1`
copies; they were copied from `out\p37-fin\legs`. `swapto.ps1` adds the
Windows 7 x64 bins stick and does not change the transfer drive's
flavour; a clean shutdown and a relaunch with the other `-Flav` does.
