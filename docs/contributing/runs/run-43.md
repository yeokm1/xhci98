# Run 43 - Release `3.2.0.0`

Phase 43 of `roadmap-usb4.md`, for release `3.2.0.0`. This sheet records
what each task did and every reading; the roadmap's task list and
decisions table are the current state.

## 43.13 the idle poll period, 50 against 500 ms (2026-10-22)

The table `runs/run-38.md` "38.3" left as T8 (deferred by the owner on
2026-10-14, the default staying 50; read then on 2000, XP, XP x64 and
Vista only), completed on 98 SE, ME, 7 x86 and 7 x64 under mode 2.
Runtime, development host A, in three sessions on 2026-10-22, the last
ending at 11:05.

**Verdict: done, the default stays 50** (owner, 2026-10-22). On none of
the four systems did 500 give a gain that could be measured: the idle
processor load, the idle poll rate, plug-to-working and the item-5
counts are the same within noise, with the guest clock checked at about
1.0 in every window. The one counter that moves with the value is
`TmrObsReleasedCount` in the idle window on 7 (about 260 a minute at 50,
about 2018 at 500). `src/xhci98.inf` (both `XhciPollIdleMs` rows) and
`src/xhci98-amd64.inf` already write 50; nothing changes in the tree.

### The vehicle

- QEMU under TCG, headless, no display client. 98 SE and ME 1 vCPU each,
  7 x86 and 7 x64 2 vCPUs each; other agents' guests ran on the host at the
  same time (1 to 16 vCPUs in all), so the idle load is compared only
  within one boot or between boots close in time, never across sessions.
- The guests, each on an overlay of its own over a read-only copy: 98 SE
  with NUSB 3.3 and `3.1.0.0` over a pristine 98 SE image, stock ME with
  `3.1.0.0`,
  7 x86 and 7 x64 from Phase 38's matrix (the `2.4.0.0` dry cut's `f`
  overlays). The kit, its scripts and every snapshot are in
  `E:\xhci98-vm\p43-13` (not in the tree; `RUN-NOTES.md` there).
- The driver: the gated `release` binaries of `dd46948c` (`XHCI98.SYS`
  `0546d544...`, `XHCIHLPR.SYS` `0ae5f606...`, x64 `XHCI98.SYS`
  `5f578d8a...`, the hashes of `out\gated-*-release.txt`) copied over an
  earlier install, not a fresh install: the INF and the registry are the
  earlier install's (`3.1.0.0` on 98 SE and ME). The 98 SE copy was
  checked by its SHA-256 read back from the disk; the NT copies were not
  hashed again (the x64 file read 345,600 bytes, the date of the build).
- The values, under the controller's driver key (`Class\USB\0000` on 9x,
  `Class\{36FC9E60-...}\0000` on 7): `XhciInterruptMode` 2,
  `XhciPollFineTimer` 0, `XhciLogVerbosity` 2, `XhciPollIdleMs` per row.
  On 9x a cold boot after each change; on 7 the value written and the
  controller restarted with `pnpctl`. Every leg's first snapshot read
  `IntrMode` 2, `IntrDelivery` 2 and `PollIdleMsRead` equal to the row's
  value.
- Attached through every leg: a mouse at root port 1, a stick at root
  port 2 (the snapshots' copy target), a USB 2.0 hub at root port 4.

### What each column is

- **Idle load**: the QEMU process's host processor time over 60 s, as a
  percentage of one host processor, the guest at its desktop with nothing
  done (on 9x a DOS prompt open, on 7 an elevated `cmd`); four minutes, or
  as noted.
- **Plug**: plug-to-working of a second mouse, at root port 3 and at the
  hub's port 1 (4.1): `device_add`, then a pointer move of 4 pixels each
  way and a screen capture for every frame; the time to the first of two
  consecutive frames changed only inside a 64x64 box round the pointer.
  Only re-plugs of a known devnode count: a first plug installs a driver
  (98 SE's Add New Hardware Wizard for every new HID devnode, ME's silent
  install of 24 to 26 s, 7's driver install of up to 3.6 s). On ME the
  plugs were made with the DOS prompt closed and 3 s between plugs: with
  no gap a plug picks up the previous one's queued moves (times under
  0.1 s, which cannot be).
- **Item 5**: a snapshot, 60 s of mouse movement with two 4 MB copies to
  the stick at +10 and +32 s, a snapshot; the counters' deltas per host
  minute (`PollRuns`, `PollRunsWithEvents`, promotions). Kicks were 0 in
  every leg.
- **Idle window**: a snapshot, 60 s with no input, a snapshot; `PollRuns`
  and peeks per minute. Events were 0 on 9x in every window.
- **Clock**: the snapshot's guest "local time" against the host time at
  which the snapshot was typed, over each window.

### Results (`dd46948c`, mode 2, `XhciPollFineTimer` 0)

| System, value | Idle load (%) | Plug, root port 3 (s) | Plug, hub 4.1 (s) | Item 5 per minute: runs, with events, promotions | Idle window per minute: runs, peeks | Clock |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 98 SE, 50 | 20.7, 10.2, 14.9, 20.5 (boot c); 24.3, 24.1, 24.5, 24.3 (boot f) | 0.22, 0.21, 0.20 | 0.25, 0.25, 0.22 | 14916, 894, 865 | 5851, 703 | 0.99 to 1.02; 1.000 (f) |
| 98 SE, 500 | 20.3, 20.7, 20.9, 21.8 (boot d) | 0.19, 0.21, 0.17 | 0.21, 0.46, 0.20 | 14656, 888, 861 | 5491, 700 | 0.99 to 1.02 |
| ME, 50 | 13.2, 13.7, 14.7, 13.0 (boot g) | 0.50, 0.45, 0.45, 0.33 | 0.49, 0.43, 0.51, 0.50 | 13481, 881, 857 | 6048, 706 | 0.99 to 1.000 |
| ME, 500 | 13.7, 13.9, 14.3, 15.0 (boot f) | 0.52, 0.48, 0.53, 0.52 | 0.50, 0.46, 0.33, 0.53 | 14723, 881, 864 | 6105, 710 | 0.98 to 1.005 |
| 7 x86, 50 | 12.9 (settling after the boot), 4.8, 5.4, 5.3 | 0.21, 0.24, 0.22, 0.23 | 0.24, 0.25, 0.24, 0.25 | 3841, 992, 901 | 3882, 1032 | 0.996 to 1.004 |
| 7 x86, 500 | 6.0, 4.8, 4.9, 5.5 | 0.24, 0.24, 0.21, 0.25 | 0.24, 0.26, 0.26, 0.26 | 3851, 987, 893 | 3856, 1027 | 0.996 to 1.004 |
| 7 x64, 50 | 4.9, 4.4, 3.6, 4.9 | 0.22, 0.22, 0.20, 0.21 | 0.23, 0.26, 0.24, 0.25 | 3851, 996, 898 | 3817, 1018 | 0.996 to 1.004 |
| 7 x64, 500 | 4.6, 4.3, 4.3, 4.3 | 0.21, 0.22, 0.22, 0.21 | 0.25, 0.32, 0.25, 0.24 | 3851, 988, 894 | 3851, 1023 | 0.996 to 1.004 |

The 98 SE pair is boots c (50) and d (500), close in time, with boot f's
50 idle window and load taken later under a heavier host (the load of
24 % is the host's, not the value's: boot c read 10 to 21 % at the same
value). ME's pair is boots g (50) and f (500), back to back under the
same host load. ME's first 50 boot read the same (load 17.5 to 22.9 %,
plugs 0.42 to 0.59 s, item 5 14331 runs, idle window 5952 runs and 707
peeks). On 7 each guest read 50, 500 and 50 again in one boot (the
values switched by `pnpctl`); the 50 rows are the second pass, whose
plugs met known devnodes (the first pass installed the drivers; its load
was 15.2, 4.6, 12.5, 3.5 % on x64, bursts after the boot).

**The timer's holds and releases.** With `XhciPollFineTimer` 0 there is
nothing to hold: `TmrHolds` and `TmrReleases` were absent from every 7
snapshot, and 9x has no timer helper (absent by design). The phase
observation's released-state count (`TmrObsReleasedCount`, design record
15 section 7.2.9: consecutive poll runs at the same short arm, the timer
released) is the one counter that moved:

| | Idle window per minute, 50 | 500 | Item 5 per minute, 50 | 500 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 x86 | 262 | 2018 | 3004 | 3451 |
| 7 x64 | 259 | 2018 | 3003 | 3442 |

Its meaning was not read further. A likely reading, not proven: the idle
period is also the window within which a drained event still counts as
recent (`XhciPollRecent` in `hcd_poll.c`), so at 500 the poller stays at
its short arm for longer after each mouse or hub event; the poll rate
does not change, since every arm waits for the clock tick (the 7 guests
poll about 64 times a second at both values, the 15.6 ms tick;
`PollIntervalMinMs` 15 at both). `PollIntervalMaxMs` read 62 at 50 and
15 at 500 on 7 x86, the 500 reading from the controller's restart on.

**Reading.** The poller is not paced by `XhciPollIdleMs` with a mouse, a
stick and a hub attached: 9x polls about 95 to 100 times a second
(about 11.7 peeks a second) and 7 at its tick at both values, so the idle
load cannot fall. The earlier partial reading of 2026-10-14 (`run-38.md`
"38.3", T8, `results.md` section 5) differs on Vista alone, which 43.13
does not cover: the idle load halved at 500 on Vista x86 (12.7 to 5.4 %)
and about 30 % lower on Vista x64, with no difference on XP, XP x64 and
2000.

### Not run

USB 2.0 remote wake on 98 SE and ME (owner, 2026-10-22: not needed
before the tick, since the default is unchanged). The test client
(`pmclient-mouse`) has never been installed on 9x. Remote wake was read
at both values on the x86 NT guests of 2026-10-14 (`run-38.md` "38.3",
T8); 7 x86's own wake legs (`PMI`, `PMW`, `PMS`) were not taken either,
for the same reason, and x64 has no test client.

### The ME guest's clock and the ME hang

- **The slow clock, 08:00.** ME's first boot at 500 (boot d, 07:59 to
  08:09, with the host nearly idle) read the guest clock at 0.645 of host
  time during item 5 and 0.317 during the idle window; its load (3.6 to
  7.7 %), its lower counts and its plugs of 0.56 to 0.80 s followed the
  slow guest (per guest second the idle poll rate was the same, about 88).
  Retaken at 500 (boot f) and at 50 (boot g) back to back, with the clock
  read in every window: 0.98 to 1.005, and the rows above. The slow clock
  never came back. Its cause was not read; it is most likely the hang
  below in a partial form (the system VM blocked for stretches), not
  proven.
- **The hang.** On ME a run of mouse plugs and unplugs with no gap between
  them hung the guest: the tray clock stopped, typed text never echoed,
  and every instruction-pointer sample sat in the VMM's idle loop
  (`c00138c0`, `sti`/`nop`/`nop`/`cli`, nothing to schedule) with an
  occasional V86 sample; no recovery in 3 minutes, the guest quit from
  QMP. Seen at 500 (boot e, 08:54, its first plug series) and reproduced
  at 50 (boot g, 09:59:46, after 24 good plugs, at the hub's port 1), so
  it is not the idle period's. Not tried on 98 SE. It is task 43.49; the
  register samples are in the kit (`legs\me\e\hang-regs.txt`,
  `legs\me\g\hang-regs.txt`).

### What it decides

`XhciPollIdleMs` stays 50 by default on every target (owner,
2026-10-22): 500 gave no gain that could be measured on any system read,
and only `TmrObsReleasedCount` differed. The INFs are unchanged.

## 43.14 read first: whether a VID/PID INF binds a refused interface (2026-10-22)

The reading task 43.15 waited on (was NOX.1's reading; design record 13
section 10.7.1, whose plan of 2026-10-13 it follows except where said).
A storage interface with no transport the bus can run - a UAS-only device
at SuperSpeed on a controller that does not stream - is refused: its one
hardware id is `USB\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_v&PID_p&REV_r`, and it has no
compatible id, but until 43.15 its device id kept the `USB\VID_v&PID_p`
form, which task 38.2 found in the 98 SE devnode's `HardwareID` value.
The question: does an INF whose only line is that VID/PID form bind it?
Runtime, development host A.

### The vehicle

- QEMU 11.1.0 under TCG, headless; each guest 1 vCPU (`pentium3,-apic`),
  256 MB, `-action reboot=shutdown`. The controller
  `qemu-xhci,p2=1,p3=4,streams=off`: port 3 is a SuperSpeed port with no
  USB 2.0 companion, and the controller reports no streams.
- The device: `usb-uas` with a `scsi-hd` (a 128 MiB FAT16 image),
  hot-plugged on port 3 after the desktop, `attached` set, each plug with a
  serial never seen before (`NOXW98V1`, ...). VID/PID `46F4:0003`, REV
  `0000`. A `usb-tablet` on port 1 for the pointer.
- The driver: the published `3.1.0.0` x86 package
  (`releases\3.1.0.0`), installed from its INF through the controller's
  Found New Hardware wizard. Every release since `2.0.0.0` answers a refused
  interface's ids the same way, so no build of this branch was needed.
- Three guests, each on its own overlay:
  - **98 SE**: installed fresh from the 98 SE CD on 2026-10-20 for task
    43.5 (no NUSB, nothing added), then `3.1.0.0`.
  - **98 SE + NUSB 3.3**: the same, then NUSB 3.3 English (`nusb33e.exe`,
    its agreement accepted in the guest, owner) and a restart.
  - **ME**: stock Windows ME (`vm\t37me\winme-stock-base.qcow2`), then
    `3.1.0.0`.
- The probes, this project's own INFs written for the reading, never in the
  tree: `Class=USB`, an install section that only writes one value
  (`NoxProbe`) under the driver key, and `.NT` sections with
  `AddService=,2`. Probe V's one line is `USB\VID_46F4&PID_0003`; probe
  C's is `USB\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_46F4&PID_0003&REV_0000`.
- "Binds": the probe's line is chosen for the devnode - its `DeviceDesc`,
  `Mfg`, `Driver` key and Device Manager name come from the probe.

### Results

| Guest | First plug, probe V offered at the wizard | Second plug, V already installed, index deleted |
|---|---|---|
| 98 SE | Wizard for "USB Attached SCSI HBA"; at `D:\PV` it named "NOX probe V device id", `D:\PV\PROBEV.INF`, and installed it. Device Manager: "NOX probe V device id" under Universal Serial Bus controllers | No wizard, no prompt: bound to probe V |
| 98 SE + NUSB 3.3 | The same | The same; "Updating hardware information database" shown at the plug, then bound |
| ME | The same (ME's wizard: "Specify the location", the folder typed) | The same as NUSB's |

Every one of the six devnodes read the same (`regedit /e` of
`HKLM\Enum\USB\VID_46F4&PID_0003` and of `...\Services\Class\USB`, taken
off the disk after a clean shut down), for example 98 SE's second:

```
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Enum\USB\VID_46F4&PID_0003\NOXW98V2]
"HardwareID"="USB\\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_46F4&PID_0003&REV_0000,USB\\VID_46F4&PID_0003"
"DeviceDesc"="NOX probe V device id"
"Class"="USB"
"Driver"="USB\\0003"
"Mfg"="NOX probe"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\USB\0003]
"NoxProbe"="V"
"InfPath"="NOXPRO~1.INF"
"InfSection"="Probe.Dev"
"MatchingDeviceId"="USB\\VID_46F4&PID_0003"
```

`MatchingDeviceId` is the device id, the second entry of the `HardwareID`
value; the PDO answers only the first as a hardware id. So Windows 98 SE,
with and without NUSB 3.3, and ME match INF lines against the device id the
configuration manager adds to that value, and an INF whose only line is a
refused device's `USB\VID_v&PID_p` binds it - silently, with no wizard,
once that INF is installed: the wizard had copied the probe into
`INF\OTHER` (`NOXPRO~1.INF`, "NOX probePROBEV.INF"), and with
`DRVIDX.BIN` and `DRVDATA.BIN` deleted before the second plug, the index
was rebuilt and the new device bound from it.

For the second plug the guests were shut down and relaunched cold (98 SE
excepted, which took it in the same session).

### Not read

- Probe C, the control: not offered. V bound, which answers the question C
  was there to qualify (C's line is the id the PDO answers as its hardware
  id).
- Windows 2000 SP4 and NT's matching in general (documented as hardware and
  compatible ids only): not read. Route 2 of the plan (a serial-number
  device's devnode, installed in its working form, reloading its driver in
  the refused form): not read. Neither can bind a refused device after
  43.15, whose device id is project-owned and differs from the working
  form's.
- The NUSB 3.3 `USBSTOR.INF`'s own VID/PID lines: none names `46F4:0003`,
  so they were not exercised; a listed device would match the same way.

### What it decides

By record 13 section 10.7.1's decision 1, the refused PDO's device id
moves to `USB\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_v&PID_p[&MI_nn]` on every target: task
43.15.

## 43.16 the legs: a refused interface under the new device id, 98 SE, ME and 2000 (2026-10-22)

NOX.1's legs (design record 13 section 10.7.1) for task 43.15's change,
on the three guests 43.14 read, each continued from the disk 43.14 left:
probe V (`USB\VID_46F4&PID_0003`) installed in `INF\OTHER` and bound to
the two refused devnodes 43.14 made; and on Windows 2000 (below).
Runtime, development host A.

### The vehicle

- As 43.14's: QEMU 11.1.0 under TCG, headless, 1 vCPU, 256 MB,
  `qemu-xhci,p2=1,p3=4,streams=off`, a `usb-uas` with a `scsi-hd` (a fresh
  overlay of the 128 MiB FAT16 image) hot-plugged on port 3 after the
  desktop, `attached` set, a serial never seen before (`NOXW98N1`,
  `NOXN98N1`, `NOXMEN1`).
- The driver: this branch's x86 release `xhci98.sys` (the gated build of
  `66840a9e`, 300,271 bytes, SHA-256
  `81E163EC145B5A99996E5E2F0456F6083A6A4247AFB0B3E786A4C309FF4E005D`),
  copied over `3.1.0.0`'s in `C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS` from an MS-DOS
  Prompt; the INF and the rest of `3.1.0.0` unchanged. The guest shut
  down, the copy read back off the disk with the same SHA-256, then a cold
  boot.
- Guests: 98 SE, 98 SE + NUSB 3.3, ME, as in 43.14.

### Results

| Guest | The plug | The wizard pointed at `D:\PV` (probe V) | The new devnode |
|---|---|---|---|
| 98 SE | Add New Hardware Wizard for "USB Attached SCSI HBA" | "Windows was unable to locate a driver for this device"; Finish: "Unknown Device", no driver installed | `Enum\USB\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_46F4&PID_0003\NOXW98N1` |
| 98 SE + NUSB 3.3 | The same | The same | `...\NOXN98N1` |
| ME | The same (ME's wizard) | "Windows was unable to locate the software for this device"; Finish | `...\NOXMEN1` |

Every new devnode read the same (`regedit /e` of `HKLM\Enum\USB` and of
`...\Services\Class\USB`, taken off the disk after a clean shut down), for
example 98 SE's:

```
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Enum\USB\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_46F4&PID_0003\NOXW98N1]
"HardwareID"="USB\\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_46F4&PID_0003&REV_0000,USB\\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_46F4&PID_0003"
"DeviceDesc"="USB Attached SCSI HBA"
"Class"="Unknown"
"ConfigFlags"=hex:40,00,00,00
```

No `Driver` value and no new `Class\USB` key: probe V, already installed
and offered again at the wizard, did not bind, on any of the three. The
device id is the second `HardwareID` entry, as 43.14 read for the old form.
The old devnodes, `Enum\USB\VID_46F4&PID_0003\<serial>` (43.14's two per
guest), were left as they were - the same `HardwareID`, `Driver`
(`USB\0002`, `USB\0003`) and probe V's `Class\USB` keys as 43.14 read -
by decision 4; the device did not return to them.

### Windows 2000

The plan's NT target, on a fresh overlay of the project's clean Windows
2000 image (`vm\t26\win2k-clean.qcow2`), the same controller and
device:

1. `3.1.0.0` installed through the controller's Found New Hardware
   wizard from the package's INF, then a restart.
2. A refused `usb-uas` plugged under `3.1.0.0` (serial `NOXW2KO1`), and
   the wizard pointed at probe V's folder: "Windows was unable to locate a
   driver for this device"; "Skip driver installation" chosen.
3. The gated `xhci98.sys` of `66840a9e` copied over `3.1.0.0`'s in
   `C:\WINNT\system32\drivers`, the guest shut down, the copy read back off
   the disk with the same SHA-256, a cold boot.
4. The same device plugged again (the same serial): a new wizard, probe V
   offered again, "unable to locate a driver", skipped.

`regedit /e` of `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB` and of the USB
class key, off the disk after a clean shut down:

- Step 2's devnode, `Enum\USB\VID_46F4&PID_0003\NOXW2KO1`, its
  `HardwareID` the one id the PDO answered,
  `USB\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_46F4&PID_0003&REV_0000`: 2000 does not add the
  device id to that value as 98 SE and ME do, and probe V's
  `USB\VID_46F4&PID_0003` line did not bind the old form either.
- Step 4's devnode, `Enum\USB\XHCI98_NOXPORT&VID_46F4&PID_0003\NOXW2KO1`,
  its `HardwareID` the two NOXPORT ids, no `Driver`; the old devnode left
  beside it, not present (no `Control` key), by decision 4.
- No USB class key past the controller's and the root hub's.

### Not read

- A refused function of a composite device (`&MI_nn`): host vectors only.
