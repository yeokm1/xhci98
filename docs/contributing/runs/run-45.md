# Run 45 - Release `3.4.0.0`

Phase 45 of `roadmap-usb4.md`, for release `3.4.0.0`. This sheet records
what each task did and every reading; the roadmap's task list and
decisions table are the current state.

## 45.24 the hardware wizard hanging on 32-bit XP while it installs `uac2` (2026-10-29)

A user's report: with `3.2.0.0`, whose free set is `usb-wdm-free` v0.1.0,
the wizard stopped responding while it installed the free set's `uac2`
for a USB Audio 2.0 device on 32-bit XP, and the device worked after a
restart. The device, its port and the reporter's `setupapi.log` were not
at hand; the owner's reading of the report is that `uac2` went in through
Device Manager's Update Driver (Have Disk at `USBDRV\FREE\audio\uac2\w2k-xp`).
Runtime readings, development host A, 15:00 to 17:10.

**Verdict: reproduced with `3.2.0.0` and `3.3.0.0` alike, and with no
xHCI98 on the machine at all.** On XP Windows' own `usbaudio.sys` takes a
UAC 2.0 function first, by `wdma_usb.inf`'s bare `USB\CLASS_01`, even when
`uac2wdm.inf` was copied in before the plug; from then on no change of
that devnode completes - Update Driver to `uac2`, Disable, the update
after an unplug, the shutdown after an unplug - until a reset, after
which `uac2` binds and plays. `uac2wdm.sys` never loads before that. The
fix in this driver is design record 13 section 10.7.2: a function whose
triple is `01/ss/20` or `01/ss/30` no longer offers the bare
`USB\Class_01`, so under xHCI98 `usbaudio` no longer takes it through that
generic line (`wdma_usb.inf`'s few VID/PID lines still match the devices
they name) and `uac2` is installed with nothing to tear down. Under Windows' own USB stack the
generic id stays; that is `usb-wdm-free`'s known issue.

### The vehicle

- Guests: q35 XP SP3 x86, overlays of `E:\xhci98-vm\q35-bases\xp\disk.qcow2`
  (`64ada103...`), stock QEMU 11.1.0 (`qemu-system-x86_64.exe`
  `47d57a60...`, it carries `usb-redir`, which the q35 bases' own emulator
  build does not), TCG, 2 vCPUs, 1 GB, `qemu-xhci` behind a root port, or
  `ich9-usb-ehci1` at `00:05.0` for the controls. (An EHCI function at
  `00:1d.7` with no function 0 beside it is not seen by XP's PCI scan.)
- The device: `usb-wdm-free`'s simulator `uacemu.py` (`3b85819a...`,
  branch `w45-uac2`), profile `hs24` (High Speed, one programmable
  clock, 2-channel playback and capture, an IAD `01/00/20`), id
  `FFFF:0201`, over `usb-redir` on `xh.0` port 1 or `ehci.0` port 1.
- Packages: `xhci98-3.2.0.0-free.zip` (`486df50b...`; `xhci98.sys` x86
  `dd230d50...`, `uac2wdm.sys` `ec4fcce5...`, `DriverVer`
  10/24/2026,0.1.0.0) and `xhci98-3.3.0.0-free.zip` (`81e6f760...`;
  `xhci98.sys` `8ff8d0d2...`, `uac2wdm.sys` `0aafc635...`, 0.1.4.0),
  installed by `INSTALL.BAT /console /yes /nopause /wdmfree:copy`
  (`/wdmfree:stage=audio/uac2` on `x1`'s second run), the
  unsigned-driver prompts answered Continue Anyway.
- Evidence: `E:\xhci98-vm\p45\w45-uac2\` - `shots\*.png` (QMP
  screendumps), `ev\*.jsonl` (the simulator's request log), `pids.txt`,
  `STATE.md`.

### The legs

| Leg | Host controller driver, package | Steps | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `a1` | xHCI98 `3.2.0.0`, `uac2` copied, not staged on that run (`s1` staged it) | plug; Found New Hardware for "xHCI98 USB Composite Device" (Continue Anyway, Finish); then Device Manager, "USB Audio Device", Update Driver, Have Disk `C:\XHCI98\USBDRV\FREE\audio\uac2\w2k-xp`, Continue Anyway | the function came up silently as "USB Audio Device", no bang (`a1-dm2`); the update stopped at "uac2wdm.sys To C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS" for 20 minutes (`u10`-`u12`); `sc query`: `usbaudio` RUNNING, `uac2wdm` STOPPED, exit 1077 (`u13`); no request reached the device after the enumeration |
| `c1` | Windows' own `usbehci.sys` and `usbccgp.sys`, no xHCI98, `uac2` from the transfer disk | the same update | the same wait (`c1-u3`), `usbaudio` RUNNING and `uac2wdm` never started (`c1-u4`) |
| `d1` | xHCI98 `3.2.0.0` | plug, then Disable the "USB Audio Device" | Device Manager waited, 12 minutes (`d1-dm3`, `d1-dm4`, `d1-final`) |
| `s1` | xHCI98 `3.2.0.0`, the installer run again with `uac2` staged ("free:audio/uac2 staged") | restart; plug | still "USB Audio Device" on `usbaudio`: the signed generic line outranks the unsigned specific ones (`s1-w2`) |
| `s1` | | unplug; Update Driver on the non-present devnode, `uac2` from the list | the same wait (`s1-h10`, `s1-h11`); `shutdown -r` then stopped at "End Program - mmc.exe" and, after End Now, at "Windows is shutting down" for 5 minutes (`s1-r1` to `s1-r3`): reset |
| `s1` | | after the reset, plug | `uac2wdm` RUNNING, the clock's RANGE requests at the device, `sndrec32 /play` of `tada.wav`: 3 s of 2-channel 16-bit 48 kHz OUT data, non-zero, with feedback (`s1-r8`, `ev\s1c-hs24.jsonl`) - the reporter's "it worked after a restart" |
| `v1` | xHCI98 `3.3.0.0` (`uac2` 0.1.4.0) | as `a1` | the same wait (`v1-u2`, `v1-u3`): not gone in `3.3.0.0` |
| `w1` | xHCI98 `3.3.0.0` | plug; unplug; `shutdown -r` | stopped at "Windows is shutting down", 6 minutes (`w1-r1`, `w1-r2`): reset |
| `w1` | | after the reset, the device unplugged: Device Manager with `devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1`, Show hidden devices, the hidden "USB Audio Device", Update Driver, Have Disk `uac2`, Continue Anyway; then plug | the update completed in about 3 minutes (`w1-h5`, `w1-h6`); on the plug `uac2` bound and `tada.wav` played (`ev\w1b-hs24.jsonl`) - the way out for a devnode already on `usbaudio` |
| `c2` | Windows' own EHCI, no xHCI98 | plug; unplug; `shutdown -r` | the same wait at "Windows is shutting down" (`c2-r1`) |

### Where the wizard waits

In the old driver's teardown: `uac2wdm` is never started, `usbaudio`
stays running, and the same wait comes with Disable, with an update after
an unplug, and with Windows' own shutdown after an unplug, under Windows'
own USB stack as under xHCI98. Which component waits - `usbaudio.sys`,
KS, PortCls or the PnP manager - was not read (no thread's stack was
taken); this bus is not needed for it, and `uac2` never runs before it.
On XP the signed `wdma_usb.inf` outranks the unsigned `uac2wdm.inf`, so
every plug of a new UAC 2.0 device there meets it; the user's "Found New
Hardware" wizard is the Hardware Update Wizard of the same install path,
or the first device after a staging that lost to `usbaudio`.

### The fix

Design record 13 section 10.7.2 (reviewed and revised): `XhciFuncCompatCount`
in `xhci_func.c`, taken by `XhciFuncId` and `hcdDeviceQueryId`; host
vectors in `test_func`. Commit `590b67e2`. No registry switch for it
(owner, 2026-10-29).

Builds at `590b67e2`: the x86 gated build `all` passed (host tests passed,
the gates and the packager self-tests clean; `out\gated-x86-release.txt`,
`xhci98.sys` release `a3de04a5...`); the amd64 gated build `all` passed too (`out\gated-amd64-release.txt`, its tree
dirty only by this sheet; the x64 images unsigned, as a clone without the
key stages them).

### The fix leg (`f1`, 19:02 to 19:30)

A fresh overlay of the XP base (nothing installed), stock QEMU as above,
this tree's release x86 package (`make-package.ps1 -Flavor release -Arch
x86`, `xhci98.sys` `a3de04a5...`) installed from the controller's Found New
Hardware wizard (Have Disk), then the root hub's; `uac2` 0.1.4.0 from
`3.3.0.0`'s free download on the transfer disk.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| plug `hs24` on `xh.0` port 1 | "xHCI98 USB Composite Device" (Continue Anyway, Finish), then a second Found New Hardware wizard for "UAC2 hs24 - SIMULATED" (`f1-p2`, `f1-p3`): no "USB Audio Device", `usbaudio` not even installed as a service (`sc query usbaudio`: 1060) |
| that wizard, Install from a list, Have Disk `E:\UAC2` | "Hardware Type" page first (no compatible driver on the machine), then "UAC2 USB audio (experiment)" offered alone (`f1-p6`); Continue Anyway; "Completing the Found New Hardware Wizard" within a minute (`f1-p7`): no hang |
| `sc query uac2wdm`; `sndrec32 /play /close tada.wav` | `uac2wdm` RUNNING; the first `sndrec32`, started in the same breath as the wizard closed, said no sound device; the second played: IF1 alt 1, 2 channels 16-bit 48 kHz, about 3 s of OUT data with signal and feedback (`ev\f1-hs24.jsonl`) |
| the control: QEMU's `usb-audio` (USB Audio 1.0, protocol 00) on port 2 | its composite wizard, then Windows' own driver installed by itself: `usbaudio` RUNNING (`f1-c4`) - the bare `USB\Class_01` still offered to a 1.0 function |

**PASS.** Under this build a new UAC 2.0 device on 32-bit XP that no
`wdma_usb.inf` VID/PID line names (the simulated `FFFF:0201` here) gets a
Found New Hardware wizard instead of Windows' USB Audio 1.0 driver, and `uac2`
installs from it with nothing to tear down. A machine that already holds
a "USB Audio Device" devnode for such a device keeps it; the way out is
the `w1` row above (record 13 section 10.7.2, the release notes).
