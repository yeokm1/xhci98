# Run 45 - Release `3.4.0.0`

Phase 45 of `roadmap-usb4.md`, for release `3.4.0.0`. This sheet records
what each task did and every reading; the roadmap's task list and
decisions table are the current state.

**On `E:\...` paths here.** They say where a reading was kept on the host
that took it; they are not files a clone has.

## 45.3 a faster cut build (2026-10-29)

The owner, 2026-10-28, after the `3.3.0.0` cut (was BUILDFAST.1): that
cut built amd64 and then x86, about 67 and 55 minutes, one after the
other. The design is `build-and-test.md`, "A faster gated build"
(reviewed and revised); the code is `5a0aa420` (reviewed and revised).
Development host A, no virtual machine; eight other workers' builds and
guests were running on the host throughout, so every time here is a
loaded host's, and the readings that are compared ran at the same time.

**Verdict: the cut's two builds at once took 1:00:12 against 1:27:38
for the same two builds of the base commit beside them, 27:26 saved
(31 %); the INF gate's own self-tests, 56 to 57 minutes alone, are now
the whole of what is left; the second tree was made by the launcher;
and at the base commit no gated build with `TEMP` under a worktree
could pass, which the same commit fixes.**

### What changed

- `scripts\build-steps.ps1` (new) runs `build-driver.cmd`'s checks that
  need no DDK as separate processes, at most `XHCI98_BUILD_STEPS` at once
  (default 4), each with its own `TEMP` and log under `out\steps-<arch>\`,
  the five longest first; each step's output is printed whole when it
  ends, then a table of every step's result and time.
- `build-driver.cmd` hands it that block, after its text checks, and
  prints `--- <step>: m:ss` after every other step and the whole run.
- `cut-builds.ps1`'s `-X64Tree` is optional: tree B is then `<A>-x64`,
  made by the script and brought to A's HEAD before each cut.
- **The measured problem (coordinator, 2026-10-29), and the way out
  taken.** The packager's self-tests read `src\pfw\obj\XHCIPFW.VXD` and
  `src\pfw\nt\objfre\i386\xhcipfw.sys` before the build rebuilt them: a
  stale image failed the case that runs the packager with its binary
  gates on ("no stamp 'XHCIPFW.VXD 3.3.0.0'", and the same for
  `XHCIPFW.SYS`); a missing one was passed over (a fresh tree's run,
  below, failed neither). Of building them first or taking the
  self-tests off them, the second was taken: a stand-in caller of
  `make-package.ps1` (one that names `-DriverPath`) stages
  `XHCIPFW.VXD`, `XHCIPFW.SYS` and `S98VSD.VXD` only when it names them
  (`-PfwVxdPath`, `-PfwSysPath`, `-VsdPath`), so no self-test reads an
  image an earlier build left, on either architecture's run; a cut, which
  names none, stages the tree's images as before. Building them first
  would still have left an amd64 run, which builds neither, reading
  whatever x86 images its tree held.
- **A second problem found on the way.** The packager's self-test "a
  directory that is no git checkout is not read as a missing tag" (new on
  the base commit's day, `2f57cad2`) made its directory under `TEMP`; with
  `TEMP` under a worktree's `out\`, as `cut-builds.ps1` sets it and the
  phase's workers were told to, `git -C` found the enclosing worktree and
  the check failed, and with it the build. `Invoke-DriverPackGit` now
  gives git `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`, the parent of the checkout it was
  given.

### The readings

| Step | Commit | Result | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test-package.ps1` alone, fresh worktree, no XHCIPFW image, `TEMP` under its `out\` | `70bd2e0e` | 1 of 1679 checks failed: the not-a-repo case, `'...\out\tmp-pkgtest\...\not-a-repo-...' has no tag v9.0.0`; no PFW case failed | 20:23 |
| `cut-builds.ps1 -X64Tree <B>` (x86 in tree A', amd64 in B, `TEMP` under each tree's `out\`; `XHCIPFW` built first in A') | `70bd2e0e` | both exit 1 at the packager's self-tests, the same not-a-repo case (1 of 1683 and 1 of 1679 checks) | 1:13:41 to the failure; the INF gate's self-tests from about 15:05 to 15:52, the packager's 15:52 to 16:17 |
| Before, at once by hand: `build-driver.cmd all` in A' and `all -amd64` in a second tree, `TEMP` outside both | `70bd2e0e` | both exit 0; packager 1683 checks, INF gate self-tests 1555 | x86 1:27:38, amd64 1:25:42; the INF gate's self-tests 57:10, the packager's about 24 minutes, one after the other |
| After, beside the line above: `cut-builds.ps1` with no `-X64Tree` in this tree | `5a0aa420` | tree B `E:\xhci98-wt\w45-tools-x64` made, its 28 `tools\` directories linked; both exit 0; release, debug and qemu amd64 records imported | x86 1:00:12, amd64 0:59:01, both 1:00:12; import 0:01 |

The after run's own log, x86 (`out\cut-build-x86.log`; amd64 within a
few seconds of it):

| Step | Time |
|---|---|
| text checks | 0:12 |
| the checks that need no DDK, at most 4 at once | 56:47 |
| - of which the INF gate's self-tests | 56:24 |
| - the packager's self-tests (1700 checks) | 27:14 |
| - the host suite | 0:52 |
| - every other step | 0:25 or less each |
| Stor98, `S98VSD.VXD`, `XHCIPFW.VXD`, `XHCIPFW.SYS` | 0:06, 0:03, 0:04, 0:08 |
| debug, release, qemu, each built and gated | 0:56, 0:56, 0:54 |
| the whole run | 60:11 |

The amd64 run's flavours took 0:37 to 0:42 each. So the DDK builds are
a few minutes of a cut's hour: `scripts\inf-gate\test-inf-checks.ps1`
(one `powershell.exe` per case) is the next place a cut's time can be
taken back from.

The runner's own self-test (`build-steps.ps1 -SelfTest`): 44 checks
passed. The imported amd64 release record, SHA-256: `xhci98.sys`
`B5C70434...`, `xhciuas.sys` `61E8B6D5...`, `xhcicm.sys` `B16B150E...`,
`stor98.sys` `245A6265...`.

### Not read

- `-Serial` and a single build alone on a quiet host: every reading here
  ran beside other work, and the before and after pairs beside each
  other.
- The signed half of a cut from the imported build, which only the key
  can run (as 44.31).

## 45.4 the USB Tree's window title carries its version (2026-10-29)

The owner, 2026-10-28, after the `3.3.0.0` cut (was TRTITLE.1): the main
window's title says which build it came from, so a screenshot or a report
does.

### The change

`bab16e60` (reviewed and revised). `xhcitr\tr_core.h` defines
`TR_MAIN_TITLE` as `"xHCI98 USB Tree "` followed by `src\xhci_version.h`'s
`XHCI_VER_STR`, and `xhcitr.c` creates the main window with it: `xHCI98
USB Tree 3.3.0.0` on this branch, `xHCI98 USB Tree 3.4.0.0` once the
version is bumped for the cut. The main window only: the message boxes,
the tray tooltip and menu and the Run value keep the plain name, and
nothing finds the main window by its title (the installer and the
single-instance check find the tray window by its class). Design record
25 section 3.1 says so.

### The readings

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `test_tr`, compiled alone with MSVC 6.0 under `/Za` | 1577 checks, 0 failures; the new `test_main_title` holds the title against `XHCI_VER_CSV` with its commas read as dots, and against `XHCI_VER_STR` |
| The gated x86 build of 45.3's after run (`5a0aa420`): `xhcitr\build.cmd`, the host suite, `xhcitr\selftest.cmd` and `snaptest.cmd` | XHCITR.EXE and XHCITR64.EXE built; `test_tr: 1577 checks, 0 failures`; "XHCITR.EXE: imports the seven allowed modules alone", "OK: xhcitr self-tests passed"; XHCITR.EXE SHA-256 `2F762CED...` |

### Not read

- The window leg on 98 SE and 7: this worker had no virtual processors,
  so no guest was started. Owed: XHCITR from this build started on a
  98 SE and a Windows 7 guest, and a screendump of the main window with
  the title `xHCI98 USB Tree <version>`.

## 45.29 the readme and the release history in the shape of the GitHub release notes (2026-10-29)

The owner, 2026-10-29: the download's `readme.txt` and
`releases/history.md` were both too long-winded. The code is `34172250`,
`d207bcfb` and `636e997e` (reviewed and revised). Development host A, no
virtual machine.

### What changed

- **`releases/history.md`.** Every entry, `1.0.0.0` to `3.3.0.0`, is the
  text the owner published with that release on GitHub (New, Changed,
  Fixed, Installing/Updating, Known limitations, the downloads), under
  its old heading and date. The text was made plain ASCII: two published
  notes held three and nine characters outside it, a dash and arrows. A
  markdown link artefact is plain text: `[wdmaudio.cat](http://wdmaudio.cat/)`
  is `wdmaudio.cat`, and a link is its text with the address after it.
  Three edits (the owner, 2026-10-29): `1.0.0.1`'s "(tested in QEMU
  only)" and `1.0.1.0`'s "Tested in virtual machines only." are left out,
  since no system is labelled so; `1.0.0.1`'s second address for
  SweetLow's stack, a mirror, is left out; and `3.3.0.0`'s Known
  limitations keep the Windows 2000 `CriticalDeviceDatabase\pci#cc_010802`
  one the published text lacks. The detailed record of each change stays
  in the roadmap and the run sheets.
- **The readme**, from `3.4.0.0` on (`make-release.ps1`'s template): the
  version's own entry (`Get-HistoryEntryLines`), a short install,
  the files Windows supplies and 98 SE's storage, how to report a problem
  (logging level 2, Save Report, Save Snapshot, `XHCIINST.LOG`, and the
  DOS report only if a maintainer asks), the directory's files and the
  earlier releases on one line (`Get-HistoryEarlierText`), with the full
  release notes linked for the rest (each system's standing, the
  registry settings, every file). XHCIQUAL is no longer a first step: it
  is in the folder list and in the report section. The three texts each
  download's readme replaces (`{DOWNLOAD}`, the other drivers' lines,
  `{MSFILES}`) are each there once, as before, so downloads 2 and 3 are
  still rendered from download 1's.
- `ConvertFrom-MarkdownBlocks` renders bullets two levels deeper (the
  published notes nest them). `check-readme-text.ps1` renders every entry
  as the cut renders the version's own, and its self-tests cover the
  entry, the earlier-release line and the nesting. `releases\3.3.0.0` and
  every earlier cut folder are unchanged.

### The readings

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `check-text.ps1` and `-SelfTest` (`636e997e`) | OK; "readme text self-test: OK", "text check self-test: OK" |
| The readme rendered for `3.3.0.0` from the template, as the cut renders it (a stand-in for the folder list) | 393 lines, none past 78 columns (the published `3.3.0.0` readme: 3,331) |
| `test-package.ps1` at `34172250` | 3 of 1697 checks failed: three source checks naming the old install and missing-tool lines, corrected in `d207bcfb` |
| `test-package.ps1` at `0581fbe0` | passed, 1698 checks (the not-a-repo and git cases among them) |

### Not read

- `make-release.ps1 -CheckOnly` and a dry cut: this worktree has no
  XHCIQUAL build and no checkout of the driver packs, so the check stops
  before it renders the readme. The `3.4.0.0` cut renders it.

## 45.30 the INF gate's self-tests, in process and skipped when unchanged (2026-10-29)

The owner, 2026-10-29: `scripts\inf-gate\test-inf-checks.ps1`, 56 of a
gated build's 60 minutes in 45.3's readings, made fast both ways the
owner chose. The design is `build-and-test.md`, "The INF gate's
self-tests, in process and skipped when unchanged" (reviewed and
revised); the code is `4da95db8` and `0581fbe0` (reviewed and revised).
Development host A, loaded by other work throughout.

**Verdict: in process the full run took 40:16 against 47:33 for the old
suite beside it (15 % less); unchanged, it skips in under a second; a cut
always runs it in full. Each case's gate run itself, about 7 seconds,
is now nearly all of what is left.**

### What changed

- Each case runs `check-inf.ps1` in the self-test's process
  (`Invoke-GateHere`): a script scope of its own per call, the `-Name
  value` words made a named splat, the global `$LASTEXITCODE` reset and
  read, an error leaving the gate read as exit 1 with what it printed
  before. `check-inf.ps1` is unchanged for its other callers. The case
  about a relative `-ManifestPath` after `Set-Location` stays a process.
- A digest of every file it and the gate read (all of `scripts\inf-gate\`,
  `common.ps1`, `test-harness.ps1`, every file directly in `src\`,
  XHCITR's manifest, and the PowerShell version), held against
  `out\inf-selftest-pass.txt`, which a passing run writes whole (digest,
  tree, time, count, an end line) only if the digest at its end is the one
  it began with. `-Force` and `XHCI98_FULL_SELFTESTS=1` run it all;
  `build-driver.cmd all` and `cut-builds.ps1` set the second, so a cut and
  any `all` build run it in full, and `both` or one flavour takes the skip.
- A self-test that needs git fails at once without it: the packager's
  (its fixtures are git repositories), and the cut launcher's two reads
  of git's exit code no longer take an earlier program's.

### The readings

| Step | Commit | Result | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| The old suite, base tree | `70bd2e0e` | passed, 1555 checks | 47:33 (18:02:12 to 18:49:45) |
| In process, beside it | before `4da95db8` (the binding fix in, round two's fixes not) | passed, 1568 checks | 40:16 (18:05:51 to 18:46:07) |
| In process, `-Force` | `0581fbe0` | passed, 1569 checks; record written | 46:26 (19:15:27 to 20:01:53, beside a full packager run) |
| Unchanged, the next run | `0581fbe0` | skipped: "nothing they or the gate read has changed since the run that passed at 2026-10-29T12:01:53Z (1569 checks ...)" | 0.6 s |
| One gate run in process, alone | - | about 7 s; the costliest statements: the required-values loop over each route's AddReg sections (`check-inf.ps1` near line 1870, 2.4 s) and the OS-supplied files loop (near line 2494, 1.9 s) | - |
| `test-package.ps1` with no git on `PATH` | `636e997e` | stopped at "the driver pack" with "The term 'git' is not recognized", exit 1; given that exit, `build-steps.ps1` marks the step failed and returns 1, and `build-driver.cmd` stops | - |

A build reported (2026-10-29) to have ended with exit 0 after this
self-test failed without git could not be reproduced: no log of it was
kept, and the readings above stop the build. The check now names git
before anything else runs.

### Not read

- The other gates' self-tests (`check-uas-inf.ps1`, `check-cm-inf.ps1`,
  `check-stor98-inf.ps1`, `test-flavour-rules.ps1`) take seconds and start
  no process per case; they were left as they were.
- A faster gate itself: the two loops above are where its own time goes.
